# Simple6050
  Midterm Project for ECE 484 Embedded systems where I interfaced with the MPU6050 accelerometer and gyroscope sensor.
This sensor is a low cost option for measuring orientation and acceleration in three dimentsons. The goal of this 
project was to create a library to allow a user to implement this sensor is a project very easily and with as few 
function calls and initialization steps as possible. The goal of the library was to setup default values for the 
sensor's configurations, but also to clearly explain other options if the user wants to change them.
This project was also required to be written in C, and be compiled using AVR with the intended microprocessor being
an Atmega328p, more than likely on an Arduino Uno.
