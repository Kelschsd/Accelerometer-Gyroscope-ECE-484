cpp_plotter.ino is a test program that plots 6 readings from the MPU6050 sensor. These values are the acceleration in x y z, and the absolute angles about the x y and z axis. Note that the angle about the z axis is plotted, but is not an accurate measurement because addition hardware must be added to the circuit. Wiring is described below:
